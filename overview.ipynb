    "# Freesurfer Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For either the CLI or custom analysis, you'll require a Freesurfer installation to create visualizations. Freesurfer is an open-source neuroimaging toolkit, which you can read more about [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). While you can find step-by-step instructions on the Freesurfer Wiki, I've consolidated them as well as I can here (some are copy-pasted directly from their instructions). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You must obtain a license key in order to use Freesurfer tools, which you can do [here](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html). Obtaining a license is free and is received via email in the form of a license.txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### macOS Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of macOS required the installation of [XQuartz 2.7.6](https://www.xquartz.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Freesurfer Installation package from this page. Double-click the .dmg file, then double-click the freesurfer-Darwin-full.pkg file to launch the installation wizard. Note the installation directory or use the default (/Applications/freesurfer), as you'll need it later. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see the Freesurfer [MacOS Installation Guide](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/MacOsInstall).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Freesurfer does not natively support Windows. In order to use Freesurfer, you'll need to set up a Linux distribution through Windows Subsystem for Linux (see the WSL documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)). Fortunately, WSL installation is fairly straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### WSL Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Powershell in *administrator* mode by right-clicking and selecting \"Run as administrator\" and enter the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wsl --install Ubuntu-22.04\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When that's complete, you should be able to open an Ubuntu Linux terminal by right-clicking your Terminal application and selecting Ubuntu 22.04.X LTS or by opening your Terminal application, clicking the down arrow in the New Tab section, and selecting Ubuntu 22.04.X LTS. You should see a line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "user@PC-name:~$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root@PC-name:~$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can create a new user by running this command and going through the steps...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root@PC-name:~$ adduser new_username\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then change users...\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root@PC-name:~$ su - new_username\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Freesurfer Installation for WSL\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following commands one at a time (you don't need to include the comments). It's likely that `wget` will take a while. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "user@PC-name:~$ cd # Navigate to home directory\n",
    "user@PC-name:~$ wget https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/dist/freesurfer/7.4.1/freesurfer_ubuntu22-7.4.1_amd64.deb # Download installer\n",
    "user@PC-name:~$ ls freesurfer_ubuntu22-7.4.1_amd64.deb # Check the installer file was downloaded successfully\n",
    "user@PC-name:~$ sudo apt-get update -y # Update package information\n",
    "user@PC-name:~$ sudo apt-get -y install ./freesurfer_ubuntu22-7.4.1-amd64.deb # Install the freesurfer distribution under path /usr/local/freesurfer/7.4.1. Answer \"Y\" to any prompts. \n",
    "user@PC-name:~$ ls /usr/lcoal/freesurfer/7.4.1 # Check that the Freesurfer release was installed successfully. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add the license.txt file to your WSL system, you can access your local downloads folder with the following command (remember that you must be running WSL as an administrator!):\n",
    "\n",
    "```cd /mnt/c/Users/<windows.username>/Downloads```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then copy it to your WSL user home directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cp license.txt ~```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can reference your WSL Freesurfer installation when you need it. For more information, see the Freesurfer [Ubuntu Linux for WSL Installation Guide](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FS7_wsl_ubuntu)"
